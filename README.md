# Sprint Layout 6 Macros

This repository contains my collection of macros for Sprint Layout 6. Some of them are made by me, some of them are just macros I needed and found on the internet. All macros made by me are free for personal and commercial use.

Since Sprint Layout macros are somewhat hard to find, I dared to include macros that are not mine in this repository as well. If you notice your macro and you don't want it to be published here, let me know and I'll remove it.
